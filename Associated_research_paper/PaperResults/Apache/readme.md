### This folder contains the inferred MRs for 8 programs in Apache Commons Math 2.2.

The MRs are grouped according to the parameters: ProgramIndex_NoOfInputs_ModeOfInputRelation_ModeOfOutputRelation_DegreeOfInputRelation_DegreeOfOutputRelation
> for example: 1_2_1_1_1_1.npz means:
>   - They are the MRs for the program of index 1,
>   - The number of involved inputs is 2,
>   - The mode of input relation is 1 (1 means equality, 2 means greater than, 3 means less than),
>   - The mode of output relation is 2,
>   - The degree of the polynomial input relation is 1 (i.e., linear),
>   - The degree of the polynomial output relation is 1 (i.e., linear).
